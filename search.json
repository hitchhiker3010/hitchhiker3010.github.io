    "text": "Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)\n\nPEFT is a method to adapt a pre-trained language model (LLM) to a specific task or domain using a small number of (extra) parameters.\nIt is a type of fine-tuning that is more efficient in terms of both time and resources compared to full-parameter fine-tuning while achieving similar or better performance.\n\nExamples of PEFT methods: - Adapter Layers: Adapter Layers are small modules that are added to the pre-trained LLM. They are used to modify the model’s output for a specific task. - LoRA and Friends: LoRA is a method that uses a small matrix to modify the weights of a pre-trained LLM. This allows for efficient fine-tuning with a small number of parameters."

    "text": "Screenshot of WebSummarizer Chrome Extension\nWith all the buzz about Code Generation Models and IDEs, I decided to test them out myself. I’ve been using these tools for my Python/PyTorch projects for a long time now, but I was blown away by how quickly they let me iterate through unfamiliar programming languages.\nI managed to create a working Chrome extension in just under 6 hours, and I didn’t spend a single penny! I’m not exactly a web developer, so I’m really impressed with what I accomplished.\nI was tinkering with the idea of making a mini version of Microsoft Copilot / Apple Intelligence for a while now, and I wanted to push the limits by running the LLM on the browser. So, I decided to build a Chrome extension that lets me summarize and ask questions about any webpage."
