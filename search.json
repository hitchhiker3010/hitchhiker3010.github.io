I’ve been using these tools for my Python/PyTorch projects for a long time now, but I was blown away by how quickly they let me iterate through unfamiliar programming languages.\nI managed to create a working Chrome extension in just under 6 hours, and I didn’t spend a single penny! I’m not exactly a web developer, so I’m really impressed with what I accomplished.\nI was tinkering with the idea of making a mini version of Microsoft Copilot / Apple Intelligence for a while now, and I wanted to push the limits by running the LLM on the browser. So, I decided to build a Chrome extension that lets me summarize and ask questions about any webpage."
